# 关系子句

从构造上认定：因为用到关系词充当连接词，所以叫作关系子句。
从功能上认定：因为这种子句都是当形容词使用，所以都叫作形容词子句。

## 关系子句的构造

名词子句和副词子句的连接词都是外加的,关系子句并没有外加连接词，而是将一个内含的重复元素改写为关系词。

制造关系子句有一个前提：这个子句和主要子句之间必须要「有关系」，两个子句之间必须要有一个重复的元素产生关系、在这个重复点上改写为关系词，才能够制造出关系子句。

这个交集点，在主要子句中称为先行词（antecedent）。
在关系子句中则可能是代名词改写为关系代名词、也可能是副词改写为关系副词。
主要子句中的先行词一定是名词类，它所引导的关系子句一定是形容词子句、用来修饰先行词。

I know something which nobody else knows. S V O 关系子句 （我知道一件事，那是没有别人知道的。）
I know something. Nobody else knows it.

## 关系代名词


先行词如果是「人」,这些代名词改写为关系代名词就是 who （单复数拼法相同，另外还有受格 whom、所有格 whose ）。
行词如果是「事、物」，这些代名词改写为关系代名词就是 which（单复数拼法相同，受格仍是 which、所有格借用 whose）。
不论先行词是人还是物，关系子句只要具有「指示」功能（指出「哪一个、哪一些」），那么关系代名词（who, whom 或 which）都可以采用由指示代名词衍生出来的 that 来取代。

### 何时应该用 that

关系子句都具有强烈的指示功能：
- 先行词是 all, anything, everything 之类标示出「明确范围」的字；
- 先行词有 first, next, last, only 等等限定词在内、或者有最高级修饰语，因而产生明确的指示时。

## 复合关系代名词

复合关系代名词一共只有 what, whatever, whoever(whomever), whichever 四个。
省略掉先行词，关系代名词必须改写为「复合关系代名词」，关系子句因为兼具形容词子句与先行词两重角色、取代了先行词，
所以关系子句会从形容词子句升格为名词子句。


### what

You mustn’t let something [he said] bother you. S V O 关系子句 C

关系副词引导的关系子句仍是形容词子句。

## 分裂句

把一个单句套进 it is … that … 的构造而分裂成为一主一从的复句。这种句型的目的是用来加强语气，里面必须动用到关系子句。

It was your friend [that(or who) stole a can of peaches at a 7-11 last night]. S V C 关系子句

It was last night [that(or when) your friend stole a can of peaches at a 7-11]. S V C 关系子句

## 强调动词的分裂句

必须动用类似「what one does is (to) V」的句型。
